        <h1>Welcome To My Web Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jacques and I am a future web developer. I still have a long way to go, but
             there is already so much that I have learned during my journey with Hyperion Developement.
             I've accomplished quite a bit, but there is still a lot that I want to learn, which is why
             I have a further 4 courses waiting for me that will help me become a better developer.
        </p><br />
        <p>I am a result-driven SEO with nearly 2 years experience in the field of Search Engine 
            Optimisation and Search Engine Marketing. My role as an SEO has also equipped me to work efficiently
            on various SEO tools such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Screaming Frog, SEMrush and many
            more.
        </p>
